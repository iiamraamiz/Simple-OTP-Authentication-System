# Simple-OTP-Authentication-System
This simple project demonstrates how a one time password (OTP) is generated through a algorithm when a user initiates a authentication action on a web page and how this genreated one time password (OTP) reaches the users mobile phone through an application interface (API) which is responsible for sending the otp to the user and authenticating it by storing the generated number in the server for couple of minutes. When the user enters the OTP the system verifies with the API whether the entered number is similar to the genrated one and gives user the access to the application or the system. This form of authentication is most common today because of its robustness and confidentiality. It is mostly used for payment gateways and applications with sensitive information.
